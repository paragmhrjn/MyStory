# Mystory 📝 — A Modern Blog Built with Astro, React & TailwindCSS

**Mystory** is a clean, fast, and fully customizable blog platform designed for developers, writers, and content creators who value performance and flexibility. Powered by **Astro** for static site generation and paired with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Headless UI**, and **React Icons**, this project showcases the best of modern frontend tools in a developer-friendly stack.

I'm a software development enthusiast with a strong passion for frontend engineering and design. I care deeply about **clean interfaces**, **user experience**, and **attention to detail** — but I'm also curious and constantly seeking to expand my horizons beyond just UI.

**Mystory** is my personal blog and creative space — built from scratch using modern technologies like **Astro**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**. It's more than just a place to publish posts — it's a living project that helps me sharpen my skills, document what I learn, and explore new technologies as I grow.

While I primarily focus on frontend development and interface design, I’m also on a journey to dive deeper into areas like:

- 🤖 **AI/ML** – exploring how intelligent systems work and how to integrate them into modern web applications
- ☁️ **Cloud Computing** – understanding how infrastructure and deployment work in the modern tech stack
- 🎮 **Game Development** – tinkering with interactivity, graphics, and performance
- 🧠 **Emerging Tech** – staying up to date with the ever-changing tech landscape

**Mystory** is where I tell my story — one post, one project, one experiment at a time.
