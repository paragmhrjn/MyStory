# Mystory 📝 — A Modern Blog Built with Astro, React & TailwindCSS

**Mystory** is a clean, fast, and fully customizable blog platform designed for developers, writers, and content creators who value performance and flexibility. Powered by **Astro** for static site generation and paired with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Headless UI**, and **React Icons**, this project showcases the best of modern frontend tools in a developer-friendly stack.

I'm a software development enthusiast with a strong passion for frontend engineering and design. I care deeply about **clean interfaces**, **user experience**, and **attention to detail** — but I'm also curious and constantly seeking to expand my horizons beyond just UI.

**Mystory** is my personal blog and creative space — built from scratch using modern technologies like **Astro**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**. It's more than just a place to publish posts — it's a living project that helps me sharpen my skills, document what I learn, and explore new technologies as I grow.

**Mystory** is where I tell my story — one post, one project, one experiment at a time.
