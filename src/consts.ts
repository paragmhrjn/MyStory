  "This blog is my personal corner of the internet — a space where I share what I’m learning, building, and exploring as a frontend-focused developer who’s passionate about design, code, and creativity. Expect posts on UI/UX, modern web development, React experiments, and thoughts as I dive deeper into AI/ML, cloud computing, and even a bit of game dev. Let’s grow and build together.";
