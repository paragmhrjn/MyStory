# Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics are broad rules of thumb for interface design. These principles help identify usability issues during design reviews or heuristic evaluations.

---

## 1. Visibility of System Status
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.

**Example:** A progress bar showing how much of a file has uploaded and the time remaining.

---

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
The system should speak the users’ language, with familiar words, phrases, and concepts, following real-world conventions.

**Example:** Using a trash can icon to represent deleting files.

---

## 3. User Control and Freedom
Users need a clear way to undo or exit unintended actions quickly and easily.

**Example:** Providing "Undo" and "Back" buttons in a form or application.

---

## 4. Consistency and Standards
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

**Example:** If “Ctrl + S” saves in one part of the app, it should work the same way everywhere else.

---

## 5. Error Prevention
Design the system to prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

**Example:** Disabling a “Submit” button until all required fields are completed correctly.

---

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
Minimize users' memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.

**Example:** Showing recently used documents in a dropdown instead of requiring users to remember file names.

---

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Support both novice and expert users by allowing customization and offering shortcuts.

**Example:** Keyboard shortcuts for experienced users, while beginners can navigate via menus.

---

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed.

**Example:** A clean dashboard that emphasizes key metrics while hiding less relevant options.

---

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Error messages should clearly state the issue and offer actionable guidance.

**Example:** "Password must include at least 8 characters" is clearer than "Error: 432."

---

## 10. Help and Documentation
While it’s best if the system can be used without help, it should still provide easy-to-find, focused, and task-specific documentation.

**Example:** Contextual help icons or searchable help sections.

---

## Summary
These heuristics are not strict rules but flexible principles. They are widely used in usability testing, design evaluations, and UX audits to improve interface quality and user satisfaction.
