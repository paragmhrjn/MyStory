# Accessibility: 

## Making the Web for Everyone

Accessibility is about making websites and digital content usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. It’s not just a nice-to-have—it’s essential for creating an inclusive internet.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Equal Access:** Everyone deserves to access information and services online.  
- **Legal Requirements:** Many countries have laws requiring accessible websites.  
- **Better Usability:** Accessible design often improves the experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

## Simple Ways to Improve Accessibility

 **Use Alt Text for Images**  
  Describe images with meaningful alternative text so screen readers can convey the information.

**Ensure Good Contrast**  
  Text should stand out from the background. Use high-contrast colors for better readability.

**Keyboard Navigation**  
  Make sure your site can be navigated using only a keyboard, not just a mouse.

 **Use Headings Properly**  
  Structure your content with headings (`#`, `##`, `###` in Markdown) to help screen readers and users navigate easily.

 **Add Labels to Forms**  
  Every form field should have a clear label so users know what information to enter.

## Conclusion

Accessibility isn’t just a technical requirement—it’s about treating everyone with respect. By making small changes, we can ensure the web is open and usable for all.

**Let’s build a web for everyone, together!**
